# Indo Data Week Hackathon - Agroforestry Project
This project aims to explore the relationship between forest cover and weather variables using regression analysis. The datasets used for this analysis are included in the repository.

**Project Overview**
This project investigates the relationship between forest cover and weather conditions in the districts of Telangana state through regression analysis. 

The main stages of the project include:
- **Data Collection:** Gathering datasets containing information on forest cover and weather variables for the districts of Telangana.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the datasets for analysis, including handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the data to understand the distributions of variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the relationship between forest cover and weather.
- **Regression Analysis:** Building regression models to quantify the relationship between forest cover (dependent variable) and weather variables (independent variables) in the districts of Telangana.
  
**Note** Majority of data preprocessing and EDA is done through the RapidMiner application

**Datasets**
The repository includes datasets containing the following information:
Forest cover data for the districts of Telangana and their associated weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity).
