# Indo-data-week-hackathon
This project aims to explore the relationship between forest cover and weather variables using regression analysis. The datasets used for this analysis are included in the repository.

**Project Overview**
This project investigates the relationship between forest cover and weather conditions in the districts of Telangana state through regression analysis. 
The main stages of the project include:
Data Collection: Gathering datasets containing information on forest cover and weather variables for the districts of Telangana.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the datasets for analysis, including handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to understand the distributions of variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the relationship between forest cover and weather.
Regression Analysis: Building regression models to quantify the relationship between forest cover (dependent variable) and weather variables (independent variables) in the districts of Telangana.
**Note** Majority of data preprocessing and EDA is done through the RapidMiner application

**Datasets**
The repository includes datasets containing the following information:
Forest cover data for the districts of Telangana and their associated weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity).

**How to Use**
To replicate the analysis or explore the code:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to view the code and follow along with the analysis.
3. Run the notebooks in your preferred environment to reproduce the results.

**Disclaimer**
The analysis provided in this repository is for educational and exploratory purposes only. The results of regression analysis may not imply causation and should be interpreted with caution.
